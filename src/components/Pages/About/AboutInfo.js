Throughout my 20 years I have moved all around South Africa and have learned an extensive amount about the difference in people and cultures in different cities. I am orginally from De Aar, which is a small town in the Northern Cape. I was born in De Aar on the 1st of November 2000 and have since moved to Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and now Cape Town.", "\nAlthough moving this much was not the most enjoyable experience as a child, it did teach me to adapt to new environments very quickly and I also met a lot of interesting people along the way. I had to learn from a very young age how to socialise with new people and gain their respect. Because of these experiences, I can now easily and comfortably network with new people and find common interest and potentially gain a business contact"],
